            <p>
              <b>8.1. Charges: </b> Customer is obligated to settle all Charges,
              including fees, penalties, early cancellation charges, and other
              amounts specified in the Agreement, such as fees for the Services
              or Software outlined in the Order Form. All Charges must be
              remitted in United States dollars. Payment terms are as follows:
              (i) Monthly Charges are due on the second (2nd) business day of
              each month and should be paid via credit card; (ii) one-time
              prepayments for Services or Software with a fixed Initial Term,
              including any Renewal Term, are due within thirty (30) days of
              receipt of the invoice; or (iii) as otherwise indicated in the
              Order Form.
              <br /> <b> 8.2. Service Credit: </b> ChildEra will extend a credit
              towards Service fees if Customer utilizes ChildEra&apos;s payment
              processing Service for processing tuition, enrollment, or other
              end-user payments. The credit will be itemized on Customer&apos;s
              invoice. ChildEra reserves the right to determine what constitutes
              &quot;use&quot; of the payment processing Service and may
              terminate the credit if it deems Customer to be non-compliant.
              Notification of such termination will be provided within thirty
              (30) days, allowing for remedial action to reinstate the credit.
              <br /> <b>8.3. Third-Party Fees: </b> Customer is accountable for
              third-party fees associated with operating or integrating Services
              specific to Customer&apos;s systems, as well as fees for payment
              gateways, credit card processing, debit, ACH, e-check, or related
              integration or processing.
              <br /> <b> 8.4. Changes to the Fees: </b>ChildEra may modify
              Service fees by giving Customer written notice at least thirty
              (30) days before the proposed change takes effect (“Fee Change
              Period”). Promotional pricing is valid for the first twelve (12)
              months of the subscription, after which it may revert to standard
              pricing without prior notice. Customer has the option to terminate

              cancellation form on ChildEra&apos;s website, effective upon
              receipt by ChildEra. Failure to terminate within the Fee Change
              Period constitutes acceptance of the fee increase, waiving any
              further termination rights in connection with fee increases.
              <br /> <b>8.5. Late Fees; Suspension of Services:</b>
              <br />
              <b>8.5.1. </b> Interest on Late Payments: Any unpaid amounts by
              Customer will accrue interest at either one and one-half percent
              (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law,
              whichever is lower.
              <br />
              <b>8.5.2. </b>
              Suspension and Termination of Services: Failure to settle past due
              amounts within seven (7) days of the due date may result in the
              suspension of Customer&apos;s access to the Services. If payments
              remain outstanding for an additional ten (10) days, Procare
              reserves the right to terminate the Agreement and Customer&apos;s
              access to the Services. Upon termination, Customer may request
              reinstatement of Services, subject to a fee determined by Procare,
              and must settle all outstanding amounts and accrued interest.
              Services charges will continue during any suspension period.
              <br />
              <b>8.5.3. </b> Collection Costs: Customer is responsible for
              reimbursing Procare for all expenses incurred in collecting
              defaulted payments, including attorney&apos;s fees and court
              costs. Procare may impose a reconnection fee if Services access is
              suspended due to non-payment. Additionally, Customer acknowledges
              that Procare is not obligated to retain User Content or Customer
              Data and may delete such data if the account is delinquent for
              thirty (30) days or more. 8.6. Free Trial Services: ChildEra may
              offer certain subscribed Services on a trial basis
              (&quot;Trial&quot;) until the earlier of: (a) the end of the
              current Trial period set by ChildEra; (b) the commencement of any
              paid Services ordered by Customer; or (c) the date ChildEra
              decides, at its sole discretion, to terminate Customer&apos;s
              access to the Trial (&quot;Trial Term&quot;). Customer
              acknowledges that the functionality of the Services may be
              restricted during the Trial Term. Changes made to User Content or
              Customer Data during the Trial Term may be permanently lost unless
              Customer purchases a subscription to the same or upgraded Services
              covered during the Trial Term. ChildEra reserves the right to
              delete User Content and Customer Data following the Trial Term if
              Customer does not purchase a paid subscription within seven (7)
              days following the end of the Trial Term. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
              TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, PROCARE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY
              WARRANTY, SUPPORT, OR INDEMNIFICATION OF ANY KIND DURING THE TRIAL
              TERM.

              <b> 8.7. Payment Dispute: </b> Customer agrees to accept as
              conclusively accurate any Charges not disputed in writing and
              delivered to ChildEra within thirty (30) days of the Charge date.
              Customer may withhold disputed portions of payments that are
              properly and promptly disputed, provided that all undisputed
              Charges are paid promptly. The parties will work together in good
              faith to resolve any disputed Charges.
              <br /> <b>8.8. Audit: </b> ChildEra may, upon thirty (30)
              days&apos; written notice, audit Customer&apos;s use of the
              Services. Customer agrees to cooperate with any audit by providing

              not unduly interfere with Customer&apos;s normal business
              operations. Customer agrees that ChildEra will not be responsible

              immediately cease; (b) ChildEra will terminate access to User
              Content and Customer Data through the Services for Customer and/or
              Users (subject to Section 9.5 (Availability of User Content and
              Customer Data) below); and (c) each party will be relieved of
              further duties and obligations under the Agreement, except as
              provided in Section 9.4 (Outstanding Payments; No Refunds) or as
              otherwise specified in the Agreement.
              <br />
              <b> 9.4. Outstanding Payments; No Refunds: </b> If the Agreement
              is terminated by ChildEra for any reason constituting ChildEra
              Termination or by Customer for any reason other than Customer
              Termination for Breach, all Charges and other amounts owed to
              ChildEra under the Agreement become immediately due and payable.
              This includes: (a) Charges through the end of the month in which
              the Services are terminated for month-to-month subscriptions, and
              (b) Charges through the remainder of the Initial Term or the
              then-current Renewal Term for subscriptions other than
              month-to-month. Customer agrees that ChildEra may charge unpaid
              fees to Customer&apos;s credit card or bill Customer for such
              fees. Customer acknowledges it is not entitled to any refund or
              credit and waives all rights to such refund or credit. Set-up
              fees, monthly service fees, and usage fees are non-refundable.
              <br />
              <b> 9.5. Availability of User Content and Customer Data: </b> Upon
              termination or expiration of the Agreement, Customer or User will
              have access to and the ability to export its Customer Data or User
              Content for thirty (30) days. After this period, ChildEra is not
              obligated to retain Customer Data or User Content and may
              permanently delete it according to its standard data retention and
              deletion schedule. ChildEra is not obliged to assist Customer
              and/or User in exporting their data, but they may request
              assistance in writing. If ChildEra agrees to assist, any
              associated costs will be determined at ChildEra&apos;s discretion.
              However, access to Customer Data or User Content is contingent
              upon payment of all Charges and compliance with Section 6
              (Acceptable Use). Upon termination for cause, access to Customer
              Data or User Content ceases immediately, and ChildEra has no
              obligation to maintain or forward any such data. <br />
              <b> 9.6. Survival: </b>
              Termination or expiration of the Agreement does not release either
              party from obligations to pay any outstanding amounts or discharge
              any liabilities incurred before termination. Sections 5 (except
              Section 5.6), 6, 7, this Section 9.6, and 10 through 31 will
              survive termination or expiration of the Agreement.

              to keep confidential any non-public information and know-how
              disclosed under the Agreement. This includes information
              designated in writing as proprietary or confidential, whether
              disclosed in writing or orally and designated in writing within
              thirty (30) days of oral disclosure, or reasonably understood to
              be confidential. Services and Software are considered
              ChildEra&apos;s Confidential Information, while Customer Data and
              User Content are considered the Customer&apos;s Confidential
              Information. Both parties agree to (a) preserve and protect the
              confidentiality of the other party&apos;s Confidential
              Information, (b) refrain from using it except as specified, and
              (c) not disclose it to any third party except as necessary. Each
              party must promptly notify the other of any unauthorized
              disclosure or use and assist in remedying it.
              <br /> Despite the above, either party can reveal the other
              party&apos;s Confidential Information if: (i) it&apos;s already
              publicly known without violating the Agreement; (ii) the receiving
              party independently discovered, created, or developed it without
              using the disclosing party&apos;s Confidential Information, as
              evidenced in their records; (iii) the receiving party knew it
              through no wrongful act of their own; or (iv) it&apos;s mandated
              to be disclosed by law or court order. In such cases, the
              receiving party must promptly notify and assist the disclosing
              party in seeking protective measures. <br /> Furthermore, the
              disclosing party has the right to seek injunctive relief against
              any threatened breach of the Agreement or its continuation by the
              receiving party, without needing to demonstrate actual damages or
              furnish a bond, in addition to any other remedies available in
              law, equity, or otherwise. All Confidential Information exchanged
              under the Agreement shall remain the exclusive property of the
              disclosing party. The Agreement does not confer any ownership
              rights or licenses to the receiving party unless explicitly stated
              otherwise. Upon the earlier occurrence of the Agreement&apos;s
              expiration or termination, or at the written request of the
              disclosing party, the receiving party must promptly return,
              permanently delete, or destroy all Confidential Information and
              any copies thereof within its possession or control as provided in
              the Agreement.

              reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and

              disclosure, or use. These protective measures remain intact
